# Mushroom Foraging 101: Safety First

Mushroom hunting rewards the patient and punishes the hasty.

## The Golden Rules

1. **Never eat anything you can't 100% identify**
2. **When in doubt, throw it out**
3. **Start with the easy ones**
4. **Learn the deadly ones first**

## Beginner-Friendly Species

### Oyster Mushrooms (*Pleurotus ostreatus*)

**Key identifiers:**
- Shelf-like growth on dead hardwood
- White to gray caps
- Decurrent gills (running down the stem)
- No ring or volva

### Chicken of the Woods (*Laetiporus sulphureus*)

**Key identifiers:**
- Bright orange-yellow shelves
- Grows on oak and other hardwoods
- No gills (porous underside)
- Texture like chicken when cooked

> **Warning:** Some people experience gastrointestinal distress. Try a small amount first.

## The Deadly Trio

Learn these before anything else:

1. **Death Cap** (*Amanita phalloides*)
   - White gills, ring on stem, volva at base
   - Responsible for 90% of mushroom poisonings

2. **Destroying Angel** (*Amanita virosa*)
   - All white, deadly
   - Looks like innocent meadow mushrooms

3. **Deadly Galerina** (*Galerina marginata*)
   - Small brown mushrooms on wood
   - Often mixed with edible lookalikes

## Essential Gear

```
- Wicker basket (allows spore dispersal)
- Knife (clean cuts prevent rot)
- Field guide with photos
- GPS or marked map
- Camera for documentation
```

## Final Thoughts

The best mushroom hunter is the one who comes home with knowledge, not necessarily a full basket.

Join a local mycological society. Nothing beats learning from experienced foragers in the field.
