# Wild Berry Identification: A Field Guide

The forest provides. But only if you know what you're looking at.

After three seasons of documenting berry patches across the Pacific Northwest, I've compiled the essential identification markers that separate a nutritious find from a trip to the emergency room.

## The Safe Five

These berries are unmistakable and safe for consumption:

### Blackberries (*Rubus* spp.)

**Look for:**
- Aggregate fruits (clusters of tiny drupelets)
- Thorny canes with palmately compound leaves
- White five-petaled flowers

> **Pro tip:** The darker, the sweeter. Wait for that deep purple-black color before harvesting.

### Blueberries (*Vaccinium* spp.)

**Look for:**
- Small, round berries with a crown-like end
- Smooth-edged, elliptical leaves
- Bell-shaped flowers (white to pink)

### Raspberries (*Rubus idaeus*)

Similar to blackberries but red when ripe. The hollow center distinguishes them from blackberries.

## The Danger Zone

**NEVER consume these:**

- **Deadly Nightshade** (black berries, purple flowers)
- **Yew berries** (red arils, toxic seeds)
- **Pokeweed** (purple-black berries on red stems)

## Field Testing Protocol

When in doubt, follow the Universal Edibility Test:

1. Smell the berry (strong almond scent = cyanide risk)
2. Touch to skin (wait 15 minutes)
3. Touch to lip (wait 15 minutes)
4. Small bite, don't swallow (wait 8 hours)
